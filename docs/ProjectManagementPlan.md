## ðŸ”¹ 6.0 Test and Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Testing Plan
This project will follow **manual black-box testing**. Each function will be tested from the userâ€™s point of view without knowledge of the internal code. The goal is to ensure that the system performs as expected based on the requirements.

**Features to be tested include**:
* User login and logout
* Registering new assets
* Updating and deleting assets
* Searching and filtering assets
* Generating PDF/CSV reports
* Role-based access control (Admin vs Viewer)

**Testing strategy includes**:
* Writing test cases for each feature
* Comparing expected output with actual output
* Recording results in a test log
* Fixing any bugs found before release

### 6.2 Version Control
GitHub is used for version control. Each developer creates their own branch for new features. Once complete, they submit a pull request for review and merge into the main branch. This prevents data loss, ensures collaboration, and tracks all code changes clearly.

## ðŸ”¹ 7.0 Project Closure

### 7.1 Closeout Plan
Once all tasks are completed, the group will conduct a final review of the project. This includes checking if all requirements have been met, testing the system one last time, and finalizing the documentation and presentation.

### 7.2 Final Product Delivery and Acceptance
The final system, including all source code and documentation, will be submitted. A presentation will be held to demonstrate all system features. The supervisor will evaluate the project against the SRS and functionality.

### 7.3 Project Completion and Review
The group will reflect on the project process, identifying:
* What went well
* What could be improved
* Lessons learned in working as a team
  This helps improve future collaboration and project management skills.
